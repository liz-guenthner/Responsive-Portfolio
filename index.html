              <p>Hello world, my name is Liz. I was born and raised in Austin, Texas and I don't plan on leaving anytime soon. I paint, landscape and build things in inter-cyber-net-land. I currently work as a Front End Developer for an advertising agency in Austin. It's fun and I can bring my dog to work so yea, things are pretty great these days.</p><p>For the record, this picture of Simon and me is about 5 years old and my hair is completely grey now. Which, now that I think about it, is the <strong>exact</strong> amount of time I've been a developer...hm, interesting. Oh, and one more thing...these pages are responsive using <strong>Media Queries</strong>. Enjoy!</p>
